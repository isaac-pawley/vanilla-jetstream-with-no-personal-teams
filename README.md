- [The blog](https://npratley.net/disabling-personal-teams-in-laravel-8-and-jetstream-1fd083593e08/).
- GitHub repository [DevLAN-io](https://github.com/DevLAN-io/laravel-boilerplate).
- The above but just the diffs between [commits](https://github.com/DevLAN-io/laravel-boilerplate/commit/ad38d105380cc797c987f44a80ee122a63fac0f9).
